\section{Licenses and Copyright}
\label{section-license}


\subsection{Which License Applies?}

Different parts of the \pgfname\ package are distributed under
different licenses:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{code} of the package is dual-license. This means that
  you can decide which license you wish to use when using the
  \pgfname\ package. The two options are:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item You can use the \textsc{gnu} Public License, version 2.
  \item You can use the \LaTeX\ Project Public License, version 1.3c.
  \end{enumerate}
\item The \emph{documentation} of the package is also dual-license. Again,
  you can choose between two options:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item You can use the \textsc{gnu} Free Documentation License, version 1.2.
  \item You can use the \LaTeX\ Project Public License, version 1.3c.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

The ``documentation of the package'' refers to all files in the
subdirectory |doc| of the |pgf| package. A detailed listing can be
found in the file |doc/generic/pgf/licenses/manifest-documentation.txt|.
All files in other directories are part of the ``code of the
package.'' A detailed listing can be found in the file
|doc/generic/pgf/licenses/manifest-code.txt|.

In the rest of this section, the licenses are presented. The
following text is copyrighted, see the plain text versions of these
licenses in the directory |doc/generic/pgf/licenses| for details.

The example picture used in this manual, the Brave \textsc{gnu} World
logo, is taken from the Brave \textsc{gnu} World homepage, where it is
copyrighted as follows: ``Copyright (C) 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003,
2004 Georg C.~F.\ Greve. Permission is granted to make and distribute
verbatim copies of this transcript as long as the copyright and this
permission notice appear.''


\subsection{The GNU Public License, Version 2}

\subsubsection{Preamble}

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it.  By contrast, the \textsc{gnu} General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software---to
make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to
any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the \textsc{gnu} Library
General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs;
and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And
you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If
the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors'
reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

\subsubsection{Terms and Conditions For Copying, Distribution and
  Modification}

\begin{enumerate}

\addtocounter{enumi}{-1}

\item
This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below, refers to
any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program'' means either
the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a
work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term ``modification''.)
Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

\item You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
  code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
  and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
  and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
  this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
  recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

\item
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
you changed the files and the date of any change.

\item
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

\item
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

\end{enumerate}


These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

\item
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

\item
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

\item
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsubsection b above.)

\end{enumerate}


The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

\item
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

\item
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

\item
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

\item
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

\item
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

\item
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

\item
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{No Warranty}

\begin{enumerate}

\addtocounter{enumi}{9}

\item
Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty
for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Except when
otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties
provide the program ``as is'' without warranty of any kind, either expressed
or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.  The entire risk as
to the quality and performance of the program is with you.  Should the
program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing,
repair or correction.

\item
In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or
redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages,
including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising
out of the use or inability to use the program (including but not limited
to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by
you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other
programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

  \LPPLsubsection{Preamble}
  \label{LPPL:Preamble}

  The \LaTeX\ Project Public License (\LPPL) is the primary license
  under which the \LaTeX\ kernel and the base \LaTeX\ packages are
  distributed.

  You may use this license for any work of which you hold the
  copyright and which you wish to distribute.  This license may be
  particularly suitable if your work is \TeX-related (such as a
  \LaTeX\ package), but it is written in such a way that you can use
  it even if your work is unrelated to \TeX.

  The section `\textsc{whether and how to distribute works under this
    license}', below, gives instructions, examples, and
  recommendations
  for authors who are considering distributing their works under this
  license.

  This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed
  and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of
  that work may be distributed.

  We, the \LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you
  the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work
  that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
  maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that
  work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting
  these conditions, then read the document \LPPLdocfile{cfgguide} and
  \LPPLdocfile{modguide} in the base \LaTeX\ distribution for suggestions.


  \LPPLsubsection{Definitions}
  \label{LPPL:Definitions}

  In this license document the following terms are used:

  \begin{description}
  \item[Work] Any work being distributed under this License.

  \item[Derived Work] Any work that under any applicable law is
    derived from the Work.

  \item[Modification] Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under
    any applicable law -- for example, the production of a file
    containing an original file associated with the Work or a
    significant portion of such a file, either verbatim or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.

  \item[Modify] To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work
    under any applicable law.

  \item[Distribution] Making copies of the Work available from one
    person to another, in whole or in part.  Distribution includes
    (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the
    Work accessible by file transfer protocols such as \textsc{ftp} or
    \textsc{http} or by shared file systems such as Sun's Network File
    System (\textsc{nfs}).

  \item[Compiled Work] A version of the Work that has been processed
    into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system.
    This processing may include using installation facilities provided
    by the Work, transformations of the Work, copying of components of
    the Work, or other activities.  Note that modification of any
    installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes
    modification of the Work.

  \item[Current Maintainer] A person or persons nominated as such
    within the Work.  If there is no such explicit nomination then it
    is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law.

  \item[Base Interpreter] A program or process that is normally needed
    for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.

    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are
    not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each
    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used
    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the
    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a
    `\LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the
    `\LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `\TeX{} language'.
  \end{description}

  \LPPLsubsection{Conditions on Distribution and Modification}
  \label{LPPL:Conditions}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the
    Work are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.
    In particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and
    no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the
    Work.

  \item\label{LPPL:item:distribute} You may distribute a complete, unmodified
    copy of the Work as you received it.  Distribution of only part of
    the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to
    distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed under the terms of
    this clause.

  \item You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated
    from a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under
    Clause~\ref{LPPL:item:distribute} above, as long as that Compiled Work is
    distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the
    Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been
    installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the
    Work.

  \item\label{LPPL:item:currmaint} If you are the Current Maintainer of the
    Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work, thus creating
    a Derived Work.  You may also distribute the Derived Work without
    restriction, including Compiled Works generated from the Derived
    Work.  Derived Works distributed in this manner by the Current
    Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work.

  \item If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
    modify your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based
    on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a
    Compiled Work based on the Derived Work.

  \item\label{LPPL:item:conditions} If you are not the Current Maintainer of the
    Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the following
    conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that
    component clearly states in the copyright notice that it is exempt
    from that condition.  Only the Current Maintainer is allowed to
    add such statements of exemption to a component of the Work.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct
      replacement for a component of the Work when that component is
      used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of
      the Work identifies itself to the user when used interactively
      with that Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this
      Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a
      modified version of this component to the user when used
      interactively with that Base Interpreter.

    \item Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent
      notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component,
      or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as
      part of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and
      accurate log of the changes.

    \item No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,
      including (but not limited to) the authors of the original
      version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not
      limited to) the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients
      of the Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly
      that they do provide such support for the Derived Work.

    \item You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your
        distribution of a modified component is made by offering
        access to copy the modified component from a designated place,
        then offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same
        or some similar place meets this condition, even though third
        parties are not compelled to copy the Work along with the
        modified component;

      \item Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,
        unmodified copy of the Work.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
    distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long
    as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the
    Compiled Work, and as long as the conditions of
    Clause~\ref{LPPL:item:conditions}, above, are met with regard to the Derived
    Work.

  \item The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence
    do not apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component
    so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that
    component of the Work as it is distributed by the Current
    Maintainer under Clause~\ref{LPPL:item:currmaint}, above.

  \item Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative
    format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part)
    is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not
    relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to
    the results of applying that process.

  \item \null
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license
      provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in
      Clause~\ref{LPPL:item:conditions} above, in regard to the Work, though it
      does not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this
      license.

    \item If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license,
      that Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part
      of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor
      the restrictions in Clause~\ref{LPPL:item:conditions} above, concerning
      changes from the Work.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item This license places no restrictions on works that are
    unrelated to the Work, nor does this license place any
    restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means.

  \item Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to,
    prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable
    laws.
  \end{enumerate}

  \LPPLsubsection{No Warranty}
  \label{LPPL:Warranty}

  There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in
  writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without
  warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but
  not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and
  fitness for a particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality
  and performance of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove
  defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair,
  or correction.

  In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
  writing will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the
  components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or
  modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages,
  including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages
  arising out of any use of the Work or out of inability to use the
  Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being
  rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of
  any failure of the Work to operate with any other programs), even if
  the Copyright Holder or said author or said other party has been
  advised of the possibility of such damages.

  \LPPLsubsection{Maintenance of The Work}
  \label{LPPL:Maintenance}

  The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder
  explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice
  in the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright
  Holder or simply that it is `author-maintained'.

  The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current
  Maintainer who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to
  receive error reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a
  valid e-mail address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer
  to acknowledge or act upon these error reports.

  The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there
  is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current
  Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means
  of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other
  significant signs of active maintenance.

  You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with
  any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.

  If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer
  of the Work through the following steps:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and
    the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an
    Internet or similar search.
  \item If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is
    still maintained.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer
      to update their communication data within one month.

    \item\label{LPPL:item:intention} If the search is unsuccessful or
      no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the Current
      Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your
      intention to take over maintenance.  (If the Work is a \LaTeX{}
      work, this could be done, for example, by posting to
      \texttt{comp.text.tex}.)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item {}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass
      maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect
      immediately upon announcement.

    \item\label{LPPL:item:announce} If the Current Maintainer is not
      reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of
      the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately
      upon announcement.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item\label{LPPL:item:change} If you make an `intention
    announcement' as described in~\ref{LPPL:item:intention} above and
    after three months your intention is challenged neither by the
    Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other
    people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to
    name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.

  \item If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes
    reachable once more within three months of a change completed
    under the terms of~\ref{LPPL:item:announce}
    or~\ref{LPPL:item:change}, then that Current Maintainer must
    become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided they
    then update their communication data within one month.
  \end{enumerate}
  A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the
  fact that the Work is distributed under the \LPPL\ license.

  If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should
  immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous
  statement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also
  announce your new status to the same pertinent community as
  in~\ref{LPPL:item:intention} above.

  \LPPLsubsection{Whether and How to Distribute Works under This License}
  \label{LPPL:Distribute}

  This section contains important instructions, examples, and
  recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their
  works under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in
  this section.

  \LPPLsubsubsection{Choosing This License or Another License}
  \label{LPPL:Choosing}

  If for any part of your work you want or need to use
  \emph{distribution} conditions that differ significantly from those
  in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your
  work but, instead, distribute your work under a different license.
  You may use the text of this license as a model for your own
  license, but your license should not refer to the \LPPL\ or
  otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under
  the \LPPL.

  The document \LPPLdocfile{modguide} in the base \LaTeX\ distribution
  explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It
  explains, for example, why distributing \LaTeX\ under the
  \textsc{gnu} General Public License (\textsc{gpl}) was considered
  inappropriate.  Even if your work is unrelated to \LaTeX, the
  discussion in \LPPLdocfile{modguide} may still be relevant, and authors
  intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged
  to read it.

  \LPPLsubsubsection{A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution}
  \label{LPPL:WithoutDistribution}

  It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your
  own personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for
  distributing the modified component.  While you might intend that
  such modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen
  by accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component;
  or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the
  modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the
  conditions of this license in ways that could have legal
  implications and, worse, cause problems for the community.  It is
  therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the
  Work identical with the public one.  Many works provide ways to
  control the behavior of that work without altering any of its
  licensed components.

  \LPPLsubsubsection{How to Use This License}
  \label{LPPL:HowTo}

  To use this license, place in each of the components of your work
  both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year
  the work was authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include
  also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of that
  component is constrained by the conditions in this license.

  Here is an example of such a notice and statement:
\begin{verbatim}
  %% pig.dtx
  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name
  %
  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.
  % The latest version of this license is in
  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
  % version 2005/12/01 or later.
  %
  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.
  %
  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.
  %
  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
  % and the derived file pig.sty.
\end{verbatim}

  Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in
  this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring to the
  three files `\LPPLfile{pig.dtx}', `\LPPLfile{pig.ins}', and
  `\LPPLfile{pig.sty}' (the last being generated from
  `\LPPLfile{pig.dtx}' using `\LPPLfile{pig.ins}'), the `Base
  Interpreter' referring to any `\LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright
  Holder' and `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y.
  Name'.

  If you do not want the Maintenance section of \LPPL\ to apply to
  your Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.
  However, we recommend that you use `maintained' as the Maintenance
  section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful
  to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it
  yourself.

  \LPPLsubsubsection{Derived Works That Are Not Replacements}
  \label{LPPL:NotReplacements}

  Several clauses of the \LPPL\ specify means to provide reliability
  and stability for the user community. They therefore concern
  themselves with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used
  as a (compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original
  Work. If this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are
  reused for a completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d
  shall not apply.

  \LPPLsubsubsection{Important Recommendations}
  \label{LPPL:Recommendations}

  \LPPLparagraph{Defining What Constitutes the Work}

  The \LPPL\ requires that distributions of the Work contain all the
  files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a way
  for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.  This
  could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files
  of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a
  line such as:
\begin{verbatim}
    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.
\end{verbatim}
  in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
  impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you
  to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be
  entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise
  the Work.

\end{LPPLicense}




\subsection{GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2, November 2002}
\label{label_fdl}


%  \textbf{Copyright  2000,2001,2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.}\par
%  51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
%  \begin{quotation}
%    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this
%    license document, but modification of it is not allowed.
%  \end{quotation}

\subsubsection{Preamble}

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document ``free'' in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

\subsubsection{Applicability and definitions}

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The \textbf{``Document''}, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as \textbf{``you''}.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A \textbf{``Modified Version''} of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A \textbf{``Secondary Section''} is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The \textbf{``Invariant Sections''} are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The \textbf{``Cover Texts''} are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A \textbf{``Transparent''} copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called \textbf{``Opaque''}.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML        % Texinfo --> TeXinfo?
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The \textbf{``Title Page''} means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

A section \textbf{``Entitled XYZ''} means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as \textbf{``Acknowledgements''},
\textbf{``Dedications''}, \textbf{``Endorsements''}, or \textbf{``History''}.)
To \textbf{``Preserve the Title''}
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

\subsubsection{Verbatim Copying}

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

\subsubsection{Copying in Quantity}

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

\subsubsection{Modifications}

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

\begin{itemize}
\item[A.]
   Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

\item[B.]
   List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.

\item[C.]
   State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.

\item[D.]
   Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

\item[E.]
   Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.

\item[F.]
   Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

\item[G.]
   Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

\item[H.]
   Include an unaltered copy of this License.

\item[I.]
   Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.

\item[J.]
   Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

\item[K.]
   For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'',
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.

\item[L.]
   Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

\item[M.]
   Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.

\item[N.]
   Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements''
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

\item[O.]
   Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
\end{itemize}

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

\subsubsection{Combining Documents}

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History''
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all sections
Entitled ``Endorsements''.


\subsubsection{Collection of Documents}

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


\subsubsection{Aggregating with independent Works}

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.



\subsubsection{Translation}

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


\subsubsection{Termination}

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


\subsubsection{Future Revisions of this License}

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


\subsubsection{Addendum: How to use this License for your documents}

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

\bigskip
\begin{quote}
    Copyright \copyright \textsc{year your name}.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
    Free Documentation License''.
\end{quote}
\bigskip

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the ``with \dots\ Texts.'' line with this:

\bigskip
\begin{quote}
    with the Invariant Sections being \textsc{list their titles}, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being \textsc{list}, and with the Back-Cover
    Texts being \textsc{list}.
\end{quote}
\bigskip

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
